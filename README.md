## BEM Methodology

The BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) convention has been applied to organize and structure the CSS code in a modular and easily understandable way. Each card is represented as a block (`card`), with elements and modifiers for different styles and variations.

## Responsive Design

The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. Specific adjustments for smaller devices have been made using media queries.
